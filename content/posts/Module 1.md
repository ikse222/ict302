1: I can identify and define key concepts in (web) content management.

  A: My progress is editing this on GitHub and it succsessfully getting onto my website.
  
I can describe and compare content management systems.

  I do not believe we covered this topic in depth. certianly nothing of note to put here just yet.

I can manage content using established workflows.

  You have made a workflow for us by giving us a time and schedule for each group to meet. you have also given us a really well executed plan on how to go about learning each week online with everything on canvas.
  
I can indentify and employ technologues related to content management.

  Personally, i am having a hard time distinguishing betweeen what is a content management system and what isn't but I am employing   my computer to content manage my personal Hugo website.
  
I can find and use resources for self-directed learning.

  Yes. I read the readings and learned that i had questions. i even had to annotate a question for part of the project.
